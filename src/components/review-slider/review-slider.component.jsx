              Samantha did such an incredible job with my hair and the hair of
              my 6 teen bridesmaids. She was so professional and easy to work
              with and made sure that everyone’s hair was exactly how they
              wanted it while keeping us all on schedule. Highly recommend!!!

              I can’t enough great things about Sam with SC Beauty! I was so
              lucky to have found her! I initially had a hard time finding
              someone for hair and makeup that was willing to do a smaller
              wedding with no bridal party. She was so gracious to work with me
              and did end up doing 2 more makeup applications for family (which
              was also fantastic). I can’t stress enough how important it is to
              do a trial. I was on the fence about the trial but so glad I did.
              We changed quite a few things after the trial and on the day of
              the wedding it was perfect. I felt so beautiful thanks to her. Sam
              did a fantastic job but she’s also a lovely person. Would 100% use
              her again!

              Samantha with SC Beauty was absolutely AMAZING! Some craziness
              happened and my original hair girl couldn’t do my hair and found
              Samantha to take over a week before my wedding. It was nerve
              wrecking since I hadn’t done a trial with her but she absolutely
              killed it! My hair turned out better than my trial and lasted the
              whole night. I got so many compliments and still do from my
              pictures! I am so happy I was able to trust Samantha to give me
              the best wedding hair.

              I could not be happier with Samantha! Hair and makeup were both
              amazing and we easily stuck to our schedule with no issues. The
              entire process, from booking SC Beauty to the wedding day itself,
              could have not been more seamless. And Samantha is beyond
              talented...my mom, mother in law and bridesmaids all looked so
              beautiful and the makeup and hair held up all night. I am so happy
              with how my hair and makeup turned out and Samantha has such a
              wonderful personality, so the wedding day prep was so fun with her
              around. Thank you!!!

              Samantha was great! I chose her because her prices were very
              reasonable, and she had showcased actual diversity in her
              portfolio. I had a very diverse bridal party, so I knew she could
              handle various complexions and hair textures. She even asked for a
              selfie of one of the bridesmaids so she could make sure she had
              the right products with her. She was also so flexible--one of my
              bridesmaids couldn't come due to health issues just before the
              wedding, so she refunded me the price of her services, and then we
              added another bridesmaid literally the day before, and she was
              able to come early and get us all done. She's such a pleasure to
              be with, and I'm so glad I booked her!

              Stop looking, this is the lady you want to hire! She is
              professional and quick to respond through out the whole process.
              We had planned to do something more traditional at the trial run.
              She gave me the confidence to go for the look I really wanted,
              which was more vintage glam. Samantha brought a beautiful energy
              to my day of experience and made my bridal beauty dream come true.
              I can't recommend or thank her enough

              Samantha was amazing to work with; cannot recommend her enough! We
              somehow only spent a total of 3-4 hours together but she feels
              like family. Sam came to my home a few months before the wedding
              to do a hair trial, where she quickly learned how much hair she'd
              be working with! She was patient, had me send photos before,
              listened to me during the appointment, and was easy to talk to the
              entire time. On the wedding day, I ended up deciding to go with a
              slightly different hairstyle than we trialed, but Sam rolled with
              it. Sam did hair for multiple of my bridesmaids, saving my hair
              for last, and we realized we only had about 45 minutes until the
              ceremony time - Sam moved FAST but meticulously, getting my thick
              hair styled and ready to go. (Sorry about all the sacrificed bobby
              pins, Sam!) All the bridesmaids loved her as much as I did, and
              she got along so well with everyone. Cannot recommend her enough
              for your big day.

              I am so grateful I picked Samantha to do my wedding HMU! She
              listened well, was communicative before and during the experience,
              was fun to have around during the getting ready process, and made
              my mom and I look great. My makeup stayed all night, and my
              extensions stayed in for days, which I loved. I had a bit of a
              wedding crisis pop up right in the middle of my makeup application
              (my shuttles cancelled one me....nightmare) and she was so kind
              and helpful while I collected myself and made a Plan B. Highly
              recommend!

              Samantha was AMAZING! We had an early wedding (which meant an
              early start time for getting ready) but she was super flexible and
              arrived bright and cheerful- it made our morning fun :) She did a
              great job capturing the overall look that I wanted, and provided
              some great suggestions! My sister and mom were also very happy
              with their hair and makeup

              Samantha left me speechless! I wish I lived in Austin so we could
              be real life friends! From the first communication to checking in
              on married life...Samantha is the best! She perfectly captured
              what I wanted for hair and makeup without even knowing what I
              wanted myself. She was so flexible when I wanted to go a different
              direction with my hair the week of my wedding than we did for my
              trial. I received quotes from about 10 different hair/makeup
              vendors and Samantha stood out for her personality, love for
              people, ability to connect with a perfect stranger, and
              flexibility. She also had the best prices and travel fee by far!!
              Samantha has felt more like a friend throughout the entire process
              and still does as we texted today about the honeymoon phase of
              married life and babies! I wish I had a reason to have my hair and
              makeup done every month just to get to be around her. She’s the
              real deal and my day would not have been complete without her!!!
              Everyone bride needs a Samantha in their corner who is willing to
              kick it into sport mode for you ;)
